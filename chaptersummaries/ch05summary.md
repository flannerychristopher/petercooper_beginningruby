In this chapter, we’ve taken a break from coding to focus on the culture, community, and ecosystem surrounding the Ruby language. Understanding the larger world around the Ruby language is extremely useful, as it’s from this community that most developers will get assistance, advice, code, and even paying work.

Being able to get help and give help in return benefits the community, helps the cause of Ruby to progress, and ultimately helps with your own programming skills.

The Ruby community is important and friendly to new Ruby developers, making it ideal to get involved as soon as possible when you begin to learn Ruby. Make sure you use the resources the community provides to the fullest as you learn Ruby and begin to develop applications. A single book cannot turn anyone into a Ruby expert, but a collection of valuable resources and participation in the community can.

Refer to Appendix B for a larger collection of URLs and links to other Ruby resources that are available online.
