In this chapter, you developed a complete, basic application that realized a set of requirements and desired features. You then extended it with some nonessential but useful elaborations. Ruby makes developing quick applications a snap.

The application you’ve developed in this chapter has demonstrated that if you have a lot of text to process or a number of calculations to do, and you’re dreading doing the work manually, Ruby can take the strain.

To keep things simple, we didn’t use any methods or flow control in our application. It simply went through a process step by step to give a set of results. This is the simplest form of a useful program. More complex programs will undoubtedly involve flow control and methods, and we’ll be covering those in more depth in the following chapters.

Chapter 4 marks the end of the practical programming exercises in the first part of this book. Next, in Chapter 5, you’ll take a look at the history of Ruby, Ruby’s community of developers, and the historical reasons behind certain features in Ruby. You’ll also learn how to get help from and become part of the Ruby community. Code makes up only half the journey to becoming a great programmer!
