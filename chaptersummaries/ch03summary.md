Variable: A placeholder that can hold (or refer to) an object—from numbers, to text, to arrays, to objects of your own creation. (Variables were covered in Chapter 2, but this chapter extended your knowledge of them.)

Operator: Something that’s used in an expression to manipulate objects such as + (plus), - (minus), * (multiply), and / (divide). You can also use operators to do comparisons, such as with <, >, and &&.

Integer: A whole number, such as 5 or 923737.

Float: A number with a decimal portion, such as 1.0 or 3.141592.

Character: A single letter, digit, unit of space, or typographic symbol (punctuation and the like).

String: A collection of characters such as Hello, world! or Ruby is cool. In Ruby, we represent strings by enclosing them in quotation marks, such as "Hello" or 'Hello'.

Constant: A variable with a fixed value. Constant variable names begin with a capital letter.

Iterator: A special method such as each, upto, or times that steps through a list element by element. This process is called iteration, and each, upto, and times are iterator methods.

Interpolation: The mixing of expressions into strings.
Array: A collection of objects or values with a defined, regular order.

Hash: A collection of objects or values associated with keys. A key can be used to find its respective value inside a hash, but items inside a hash have no specific order. It’s a lookup table,from numbers, to text, to arrays, to objects of your own creation. (Variables were covered in Chapter 2, but this chapter extended your knowledge of them.)
