RDoc: A tool that comes with Ruby that builds HTML documentation using the structure and comments in yoursource code.

Debugging: The process of resolving errors in source code, often by stepping through and inspecting the state of a program in situ.

Test-driven development/test-first development: The development process of first writing tests that enforce certain expectations, then writing the code to produce the correct results.

Behavior-driven development is a popular alternative that merely uses different semantics.

Test case: A group of tests to check the functionality of a section of your program (for example, a class or module).

Assertion: A single test to see whether a certain condition or result is met, which checks that a certain piece of code is working properly.

Unit testing: The process of testing code by making assertions on its various pieces of functionality to make sure each operates as expected.

Optimization: The process of improving the efficiency of your code by reworking algorithms and finding new ways of solving problems.

Benchmarking: A process involving testing the speed of your code to see how quick it is under certain conditions, or using certain methods and algorithms. You can use the benchmark results to compare different versions of code, or compare coding techniques.

Profiling: A process that shows you which methods and routines are taking up the most execution time (or memory) in your programs.
