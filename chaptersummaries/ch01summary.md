In this chapter, we’ve focused on making sure Ruby is properly installed and that you can run the irb tool, which you’ll be using over the next several chapters.

Although Ruby is an easy language to learn and develop with, it’s easy to become overwhelmed with the administration of Ruby itself, its installation, and its upgrades. As Ruby is a language constantly in development, it’s possible that points covered in this chapter will go out of date and other ways to install Ruby will come along.

An important part of being a proficient Ruby developer is being able to use the resources the Ruby community makes available, and being able to find the latest sources of help over time. The Ruby community, including your humble author, can provide help in most cases, and a variety of resources to try are covered in Chapter 5 and Appendix B.
